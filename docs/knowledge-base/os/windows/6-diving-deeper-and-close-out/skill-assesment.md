# Skills Assessment - Windows Fundamentals

Inlanefreight recently had an incident where a disgruntled employee in marketing accessed an internally hosted HR share and deleted several confidential files & folders. Thankfully, the IT team had good backups and restored all of the deleted data. There are now concerns that this disgruntled employee was able to access the HR share in the first place. After performing a security assessment, you have found that the IT team may not fully understand how permissions work in Windows. You are conducting training and a demonstration to show the department good security practices with file sharing in a Windows environment as well as viewing services from the command line to check for any potential tampering.
